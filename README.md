# TIPE 2023/24 - How can hyperbolic geometry defy our intuition?
My submission for the 2023 TIPE (Travail d'Initiative Personelle Encadré). This "engine" is very simplified and other options like RogueViz should be preffered as actual hyperbolic game engines.

## What's the TIPE ?

It's a project you conduct on a specific theme to present at your oral exams in CPGE (french schools made to enter engineering schools). Rou are presented a theme (here, 'Game and Sports') and you have to develop a project that you will conduct entirely by yourself, to show your abilities at conceptualizing an idea, creating models, conducting some research and some experiments etc.
My project is making an engine supporting hyperbolic geometry and using it to create a game that illustrates how hyperbolic geometry can defy our common geometric intuition.

## Contents

The "engine" file contains the main functions to create a hyperbolic plane tesselation, control the camera, and display it - The algorithms to do that are largely inspired from HyperRogue (https://store.steampowered.com/app/342610/HyperRogue/) and a bunch of papers from Eryk Kopczyński. 
The "minesweeper" file is my version of Hyperbolic Minesweeper, mainly made to show how to use the "engine" and to illustrate how differently hyperbolic geometry behaves from our euclidean geometry (both visually and theoretically)
